* Vision
** Mobile App
*** The UI should present the following inputs:
**** A way to pick how much bitcoin they want to buy.
**** A way to input a bitcoin wallet address.
***** Pasting into a text field
***** Scanning a QR code with the camera
**** A way to input card information for payment.
**** A big "Buy" button to start the transaction.
*** The user should know the status of his transaction as it happens.
*** User accounts should be optional.
**** How could past transactions be displayed securely?
**** Maybe we could use the phone's local storage to maintain a private list of past transactions.
**** That way the app won't have to talk to the server for this info.
** Server
*** It should provide an endpoint that accepts the inputs the mobile app sends.
*** Since the buying process takes time, it should be able to send updates to the mobile app on its progress.
**** Received money
**** Bought bitcoin
**** Transferred bitcoin to address
***** At this point, our end of the contract is complete, and we could even give them a link to https://blockchain.info/ that confirms to everyone that we held up our end of the deal.

* Log
** <2017-05-22 Mon> Making it build on Android
*** What a pain in the ass that was.
*** I had to install extra Android SDKs, because rnn wanted version 25.0.1 of the SDK.
*** I had to change some Java code as described in https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/#/installation-android .
*** Also had to do this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16748737/grunt-watch-error-waiting-fatal-error-watch-enospc .
*** The number of open issues worries me https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/issues .
** <2017-05-20 Sat> Made Tasks and Vision their own sections in this document.
*** I also added a checkbox list for choosing our tech stack.
*** Hit C-c C-c to toggle a checkbox in a leaf node.
** <2017-05-19 Fri> Started the project.
